# Atticus Front-End Software Engineer Assessment

Thank you so much for your interest in Atticus, and for taking the time to do this. Our goal today is to gain insight into how you make decisions in the face of ambiguity. Below, we’ll present a software problem with enormous scope and no “right” way forward. We’re excited to see how you approach the challenge, and we’ll be rooting for your success.

## Problem

Please create a React-based application for an iTunes- or Spotify-like app that manages and plays music from a digital library. Such an app might include functionality like:
- Playing a song, album, or playlist
- Viewing all the songs for a given artist grouped by album
- Creating playlists (manually curated sets of songs)
- Displaying album art in different sizes
- Sorting by year, genre, album, artist, song length, etc

First, define and document the features you believe would make an excellent MVP. Do not try to include all possible functionality or you will run out of time. (For example, you don’t need to include all of the sample features listed above.) Instead, focus on the core functionality you believe a music player would need.

Next, build out the full React component hierarchy for the application as you view it. This hierarchy should be devoid of much in terms of HTML.

Lastly, build out as much HTML and CSS as possible with the remaining time. Including wiring up the calls the API endpoints where applicable.

In the `src/api` directory you'll find methods you can use to make API calls. You'll also find type definitions for a song and a playlist. Feel free to make use of those methods as is and add to them as required.

## Deliverable

Your final product should include:
1. **Your source code**. Please ensure the provided code “compiles” and can run. Abide by good code style based on canonical preferences of each language, and include all references to third-party libraries in language-approved formats (e.g., requirements.txt, package.json, gemfile, etc.).
2. **Brief documentation**. Please explain your choices and reasoning for the set of functions you implemented in an included README. Optionally, if you’d like, you may include a chronological roadmap for feature improvements you’d make in the future. 

## Instructions
Before you start, please take 30 minutes to review this and ask questions. You should direct all questions to Sam.Aronoff@atticus.com, and I’ll reply promptly.
Once you begin, the work should take approximately 2-3 hours — no more. Complete as much as you can in the allotted time, and submit what you have once it’s done.

To submit the project, please either allow access to your fork on GitHub.

# About the Repo
